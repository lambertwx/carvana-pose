Pose estimation for carvana dataset

## Data
I took all the Carvana data (everything they distribute as test and train for their image masking challenge) and adapted it for pose estimation by splitting it as follows:

Training: 3943 examples of each pose  
Validation: 1315 examples of each pose  
Test: 1314 examples of each pose  

This corresponds to a 60/20/20 split between train/validate/test.
